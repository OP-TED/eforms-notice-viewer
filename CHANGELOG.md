# eForms Notice Viewer 0.1.0 Release Notes

This is the first release of the eForms Notice Viewer application.

The eForms Notice Viewer is a sample command line application which demonstrates how you can use the [eForms SDK](https://github.com/OP-TED/eForms-SDK) in a metadata driven application that visualises eForms notices.

The documentation is available at: https://docs.ted.europa.eu/eforms/latest/notice-viewer

This version depends on the eForms SDK version 0.6.2, and the EFX toolkit for Java version 0.1.1.
