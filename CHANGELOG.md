# eForms Notice Viewer 0.9.0 - Release Notes

_The eForms Notice Viewer is a sample command line application that demonstrates how you can use the [eForms SDK](https://github.com/OP-TED/eForms-SDK) in a metadata driven application that visualises eForms notices._

---
## In this release:

This is the first version of the Notice Viewer, that uses the new, pre-release version 2.0.0-alpha.1 of the EFX Toolkit. As a result, the application:  

- Now supports EFX-2 templates, and therefore can visualise notices created with SDK-2.
- Can no longer visualise notices created with pre-release versions of SDK-1 (SDK 0.x.x).

---

Documentation for this sample application is available at: https://docs.ted.europa.eu/eforms/latest/notice-viewer

This version depends on:
 - [EFX toolkit for Java](https://github.com/OP-TED/efx-toolkit-java) version 2.0.0-alpha.1.
 - [eForms Core for Java](https://github.com/OP-TED/eforms-core-java) library version 1.0.5.
