# eForms Notice Viewer 0.2.0 Release Notes

The eForms Notice Viewer is a sample command line application which demonstrates how you can use the [eForms SDK](https://github.com/OP-TED/eForms-SDK) in a metadata driven application that visualises eForms notices.

In this release we added the ability to visualise notices created with eForms SDK 0.7.x.

We also added to the notice viewer the ability to automatically download and use new versions of the SDK as they become available. You can use our approach as an example on how to create an application that maintains and uses several versions of the eForms SDK.

The documentation is available at: https://docs.ted.europa.eu/eforms/latest/notice-viewer

This version depends on the EFX toolkit for Java version 0.2.0.
