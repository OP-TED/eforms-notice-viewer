# eForms Notice Viewer 0.4.0 Release Notes

_The eForms Notice Viewer is a sample command line application that demonstrates how you can use the [eForms SDK](https://github.com/OP-TED/eForms-SDK) in a metadata driven application that visualises eForms notices._

---
## In this release:

This release builds on the changes introduced with [EFX Toolkit version 1.0.3](https://github.com/OP-TED/efx-toolkit-java/releases/tag/1.0.3), which allow the Notice Viewer to render a comma separated list of labels from a sequence of field values.

This version depends on the EFX toolkit for Java version 1.0.3.
